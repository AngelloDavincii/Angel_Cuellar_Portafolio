# Angel_Cuellar_Portafolio
Thanks for watching my portafolio where you can see some of my capabilities as a Data Scientist and Django Developer. 

# Project 5:
Created a web app in django for maintenance of multiple services from a residential.
It includes features like generating reports, send mails, manage users and neighbors, logings and create pdf's.
I used technologies like ajax. For frontend I used bootstrap and other libraries like datatables or jquery.

In the image you can verify that I made some graphs where I apply pandas and I'm pretty sure that I can apply different
and more complex data science if it is required for other projects.
