# Angel_Cuellar_Portafolio
Thanks for watching my portafolio where you can see some of my capabilities as a Data Scientist and Django Developer. 

# [Project 1: Summary Datacamp Course and Concepts](https://github.com/AngelloDavincii/Data_Science_trackcourse_Summary/blob/main/DataScienceTrackDatacamp.ipynb)
Maybe this is the most personal project that I have, where in some jupyter notebooks and docs I put the most relevant
code and comments about Datacamp data Science career path, where I learned about multiple themes like modeling, data
exploration, data cleaning and libraries. If you are a Data Scientist I think that maybe it would be userful in some aspect.

# Project 5: Django app for residentials
Created a web app in django for maintenance of multiple services from a residential.
It includes features like generating reports, send mails, manage users and neighbors, logings and create pdf's.
I used technologies like ajax. For frontend I used bootstrap and other libraries like datatables or jquery.

In the image you can verify that I made some graphs where I applied pandas and I'm pretty sure that I can apply different
and more complex data science if it is required for other projects.
